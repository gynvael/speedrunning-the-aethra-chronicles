# Any% v1.1 (DOSBox) OvG0 Route

  * **Route version:** 2026-02-25

A route for the [Any% v1.1 (DOSBox)](/category-rules.md#any-v11-dosbox) category. It should take below 3 minutes to finish.

## Preparation

You'll need a very-late-game save that meets the following requirements:

   * You have a mage who can cast Pass Through Stone (PTS), Beacon, and Teleport. The more mana they have the better.
   * You have a bard who can cast Soothing the Savage Beastye (SSB).
   * You have the following items in your inventory: Baby or Dead Baby, Key Talisman, both Half of Key(s).

Make a copy of this safe. You'll have to restore it for every run.

## Route

Basically you'll start with the [Overwrite with GAME0](/glitches/overwrite-with-GAME0.md) glitch over a fully prepared party and then sprint to the last boss fight location, only to escape the fight with the Queen/Vizier and teleport back to Stormhaven to return the Baby Prince to the King.

The reason to trigger the fight with Queen/Vizier is because that sets the King's quest flag to a non-zero value, and this is required for the King to accept the return of the Baby Prince.

Details follow:

1. Run the game, skip intro, and [hold F3](/tricks/sleep-divisor-f2-f3.md).
2. `(S)tart or Restart the game`, select the pre-prepared slot, and start the timer when clicking `Yes`.
3. Immidiately exit DOSBox (e.g. `CTRL+F9`) and start it and the game again (remember that DOSBox load time doesn't count, per category rules).
4. Hold F3, `(P)lay or Load Game`, select same slot.
5. Confirm exiting dungeon and head south to exit the city.
6. Cast Beacon.
7. Run full speed to the Ring mountain passage entry while running away from any encounters.
8. PTS through 3 levels of Ring mountain passage.
9. If needed, camp outside to regain mana.
10. Enter Lake passage and PTS through it.
11. If needed, camp to regain mana.
12. Enter the Outer sanctum, run or PTS to Inner sanctum, and then to main boss room.
13. Trigger the fight with the Queen/Vizier and cast SSB as soon as you can.
14. Cast Teleport and sprint to the Castle/King.
15. Time stops once you return Baby Prince.
